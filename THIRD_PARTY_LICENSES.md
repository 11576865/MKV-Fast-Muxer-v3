## @ffmpeg/core

The project currently redistributes:

- `@ffmpeg/core` 0.12.10 — GPL-2.0-or-later

This package provides the single-threaded FFmpeg WebAssembly core
(`ffmpeg-core.js` / `ffmpeg-core.wasm`). Its npm package metadata declares
the package license as `GPL-2.0-or-later`.

Upstream source and license information:
https://github.com/ffmpegwasm/ffmpeg.wasm

FFmpeg itself and libraries compiled into a particular FFmpeg build may carry
additional LGPL/GPL-compatible license obligations. The WebAssembly core keeps
its own upstream licensing; it is not relicensed under this repository's MIT
license.

When redistributing a modified or replacement FFmpeg WebAssembly core, review
the exact build configuration and the corresponding source/license obligations
for that build before distribution.
